                <br>
                The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an European Union (EU) regulation (2016/679) that enhances current data protection laws and rights for EU citizens. This enhances data protection rights for data subjects and obligates companies to be more transparent.

                When will the GDPR take effect?
                <br>
                <br>
                The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force on the 25th of May 2018.

                <br>
                GDPR applies to anyone who holds or processes the data of an EU citizen, regardless of whether you are based in the EU or a third country, and enhances the data rights of all EU citizens. More information can be found on the EU’s website.
